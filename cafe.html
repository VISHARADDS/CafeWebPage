            The Dreamy Brew Coffee Shop and Gallery offers a 
           unique coffee house environment unlike any other in Sri Lanka.
            We are not only a place to drop in and get your morning cup 
          of coffee (although you are more than welcome to do that),
           we are a place where you can sit down and enjoy that tailor-made cup of coffee. 
      If you need to work, we have a seating area created specifically for you. 
      If you need to rest, we have a soft-seating area in front of a stone fire 
      place that is perfect for your weary mind and body. We offer a delicious 
      variety of coffee from Safehouse Coffee made by our professionally trained baristas. 
      We have everything from classic coffee to our house made specialty beverages. 
       All of our sauces & syrups are made in-house with all natural ingredients 
       (no chemicals or preservatives) ensuring you the highest quality in taste & health. 
        You can complete your coffee with one of our delicious sweet treats made by our very own baker.
